## "Non-Material" Components

These components are following the Material Design principles, but not part of the [material components](https://material.io/guidelines/components/).

The goal is to share a couple of components which are used internally but not material.

**Currently Available components:**

* ✓ `<skawa-infobar>`
* ✓ `<skawa-master-detail>`
* ✓ `<skawa-ckeditor>`
* ✓ `<skawa-markdown-editor>`
* ✓ `<skawa-nav-item>`
* ✓ `<skawa-sidebar-item>`

**Currently Available directives**:

* ✓ `*featureEnabled` and `*featureDisabled`

**Currently Available pipes:**

* ✓ `hexColorize`
